# coachescornerapp_project2
Welcome to the Coaches Corner!
This app is designed for high school and college football coaches to converge all of their daily activities and recruitment operations.
Coaches Corner will allow coaches to upload practice schedules, playbooks, film footage (that can be analyzed professionally from both sides of the ball).
This app will allow coaches to comunicate amongst each other in a controlled and secure environment. 
Each coach will create their own pages and be able to upload a profile picture with their position title, bio and experience.
Users will be allowed to to email players, parents, potential schools, film analysts and more.
The application will converge all things regarding high school and football sports. Examples include NCAA rules, test scores and grade point averages needed to apply for and attend college and so much more!
